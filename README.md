When using the `multiprocessing` module, logging becomes less useful since
sub-processes should log to individual files/streams or there's the risk of
records becoming garbled.

This simple module implements a `Handler` that when set on the root
`Logger` will handle tunneling the records to the main process so that
they are handled correctly.

It's currently tested in Linux and Python 2.7 & 3.3+.

Pypy3 hangs on the tests so I don't recommend using it.

Pypy has synchronization issues.

It does not work on Windows and I believe it could not work.

# Origin

This library was taken verbatim from a [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/641420/how-should-i-log-while-using-multiprocessing-in-python)
and extracted into a module so that I wouldn't have to copy the code in every
project.

Later, several improvements have been contributed.

# Usage

Before you start logging but after you configure the logging framework (maybe with `logging.basicConfig(...)`), do the following:

    import multiprocessing_logging

    multiprocessing_logging.install_mp_handler()

and that's it.

## With multiprocessing.Pool

When using a Pool, make sure `install_mp_handler` is called before the Pool is instantiated, for example:

    import logging
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    from multiprocessing_logging import install_mp_handler
    
    logging.basicConfig(...)
    install_mp_handler()
    pool = Pool(...)
